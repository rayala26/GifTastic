# GifTastic

*This application uses Ajax requests to get information from the giphy API, then show images on a website. 

*Each TV Show is represented by a button at the top and by clicking that button, 10 gifs will appear with rating.

*Additionally, clicking the gif image once, will make it animate. 

*Users can add more TV Shows to the existing list in the textbox provided. After the new TV Show is entered, a new button will appear in the list already compiled.
